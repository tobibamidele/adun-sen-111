        <h3>Topic: Introduction to Web Development</h3>
        <p><strong>Lecturer:</strong> Mr Bernard Ephraim</p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> 100</p>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
        <p>
            The course began with a foundational look at <strong>web development</strong>, defined as the tasks associated with creating, building, and 
            maintaining websites and web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            1. <strong>Types of development:</strong> The field is categorized into <em>front-end</em> (client-side), <em>back-end</em> (server-side), and <em>full-stack</em> (both).<br><br>
            2. <strong>Website Classification:</strong> Websites can be static (fixed content) or dynamic (interactive and database-driven and rely on server side programming languages).<br><br>
            3. <strong>Requirements:</strong> Web development necessitates specific hardware, such as <em>Server</em> (central computers serving responses) and <em>Client</em> (user devices with browsers), 
            alongside software like text editors (Sublime Text, Notepad++), HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br><br>

        <h3>Topic: Basic HTML Document Structure</h3>
        <p><strong>Lecturer:</strong> Mr Bernard Ephraim</p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> 100</p>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
        <p>This week focused on <strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong> document structure, including elements, tags, and basic syntax.</p>
        <p>
            1. <strong>Structure:</strong> A standard HTML document uses the <em>.html</em> or <em>.htm</em> file extension. and follows a specific layout including <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</code> 
            (indicating HTML5) and other tags for page content.
            <br><br>
            2. <strong>Tags and Syntax:</strong> The anatomy of opening anc closing tags noting attributes like <code>class</code>, <code>id</code>, and <code>style</code>.<br><br>

        <h3>Topic: Introduction to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h3>

        <p><strong>Level:</strong> 100</p>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
        <p>Week 3 introduced <strong>CSS</strong> a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and outlook of HTML objects</p>
        <p>
            1. <strong>Modes of CSS:</strong> There are 3 ways to apply styles. <br>
            i) <strong>Inline styling</strong> (directly in the HTML element) <br>
            ii) <strong>Internal styling</strong> Withing a style tag in the head section of the HTML document. <br>
            iii) <strong>External styling</strong> Linked to a seperated <strong>.css</strong> file.

        <h3>Topic: Introduction to JavaScript</h3>
        <p><strong>Lecturer:</strong> Mr Bernard Ephraim</p>
        <p><strong>Level:</strong> 100</p>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
        <p>Week 6 introduced <strong>JavaScript</strong>, a programming language that enables interactive web pages and dynamic content.</p>
        <p>
            1. <strong>Programming concepts:</strong> Concepts such as variables (declared by var), literals (strings or numbers), arrays (ordered collections), and objects (collections with keys) were introduced..<br><br>
            2. <strong>Logic and Control:</strong> The class covered mathematical operators (following BODMAS), comparators (==, !=, &lt;, &gt;) and logical operators (&&, ||, !).<br><br>
            3. <strong>Functions and Events:</strong> Functions are reusable blocks of code, and events are actions that occur in response to user interactions (e.g., clicks, keypresses).<br><br>
            4. <strong>Conditional Statements and Loops:</strong> These control the flow of code execution based on conditions (if, else if, else) and allow for repeated execution (for, while).<br><br>
            5. <strong>Outputting data:</strong> Methods like <code>console.log()</code> (for debugging) and <code>document.write()</code> (for writing to the webpage) were covered.
